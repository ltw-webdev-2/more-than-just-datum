# More than just datum

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Create a prototype interface for a web application using forms & tables
- The form’s `action` attribute doesn’t need to point anywhere, `action="#"` works okay.
- Use grids, type systems, & modules as much as possible—there should be very little inside the `main.css`
- Data can be found inside the `play-structures-and-areas.csv` file.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
